	•	Folders on the left instead of within the list of emails
	•	No main function bar, the entire screen is fitted with the content of the email



1.2. 
	•	Changed the size of avatar3.png to width=5%, to keep the consistency of the list of mails and the mail content, also improves the overall appearance of the contents, minimising unnecessary space
	•	Changed size of “Name” and “Time” to <h4 style="font-size:100%"> to improve the look of the contents of the mail, as timestamps are usually not that big and bold in emails.
